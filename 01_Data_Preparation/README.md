### Data Preprocessing  
Data Cleansing puts data into the right shape and quality for analysis. It includes many different functions, for example the following:

Basics (select, filter, removal of duplicates, …)
Sampling (balanced, stratified, ...)
Data Partitioning (create training + validation + test data set, ...)
Transformations (normalisation, standardisation, scaling, pivoting, ...)
Binning (count-based, handling of missing values as its own group, …)
Data Replacement (cutting, splitting, merging, ...)
Weighting and Selection (attribute weighting, automatic optimization, ...)
Attribute Generation (ID generation, ...)
Imputation (replacement of missing observations by using statistical algorithms)  
  
### Data Wrangling
Feature Engineering selects the right attributes to analyze. You use domain knowledge of the data to select or create attributes that make machine learning algorithms work. Feature Engineering process includes:

Brainstorming or testing of features
Feature selection
Validation of how the features work with your model
Improvement of features if needed
Return to brainstorming / creation of more features until the work is done
